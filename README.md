The main objectives of this experiment are:
  • Understanding about MOSFET.
  • Understanding the transfer function and the threshold voltage.
  • To get familiar with oscilloscope.
  • Transfer of the generic description of a differential amplifier from the literature to a given problem
  • Finding ways to optimize a functional circuit
