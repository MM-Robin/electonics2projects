The main objectives of this experiment are:
  • Understanding about MOSFET.
  • Understanding the transfer function and the threshold voltage.
  • Understanding the MOSFET applications as switch and single-ended amplifier
  •	Definition of required input and output characteristics of an amplifier circuit.
  • Understanding thefunction andthe internal setup of the basic integrated circuit NE555.
  • To get familiar with oscilloscope.
  • Transfer of the generic description of a differential amplifier from the literature to a given problem.
  • Finding ways to optimize a functional circuit.
